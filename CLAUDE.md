## What this is

**BudgetBuddy** is an internal Google Ads budget pacing tool for Commit Agency. It replaces a Google Ads MCC Script + Supabase pipeline that previously ran the same job.

It connects to Google Ads via OAuth, pulls MTD spend per campaign, compares it to a monthly budget sourced from a linked Google Sheet, and tells you whether each campaign is over-pacing, under-pacing, or on-track. It can optionally push budget adjustments back to Google Ads and auto-pause campaigns that blow past a spend threshold.

The original script (`scripts/google_ads_budget_pacer.js`) is kept for reference only — do not deploy it while BudgetBuddy is active.

## Data flow

1. User connects Google account via OAuth → refresh token stored in `google_oauth_tokens`.
2. User imports accounts from MCC or adds manually → saved to `accounts`.
3. User links a Google Sheet per account → `account_settings.google_sheet_id`.
4. **Google Ads section sync** (`POST /api/sheets/<id>/sync-google-ads`):
   - Reads `[Account Name, Campaign Filter, Budget, MTD Spend]` rows
   - Tags campaigns with `budget_label` + `campaign_filter` for composite segmentation
   - Sets `monthly_budget` on each campaign (distributed by segment)
5. Pacing run (manual or scheduled via APScheduler at 06:00 UTC):
   - Syncs budgets from sheet first (Google Ads section)
   - Fetches MTD spend + clicks + conversions via GAQL
   - Calculates expected spend for days elapsed
   - Computes `pace_ratio = actual / expected`
   - Recommends daily budget adjustment
   - Optionally pushes new daily budget to Google Ads
   - Writes a `PacingData` row per campaign + a `PacingRun` audit record
   - Writes MTD spend back to sheet col D
6. Dashboard reads latest `PacingData` per campaign to render status pills and spend bars.

## Business rules ported from the MCC script

These rules were in `google_ads_budget_pacer.js` and are now enforced in the Flask backend:

### A. Composite segmentation (`budget_label` / `campaign_filter`)
An account can have multiple rows in the Google Ads sheet section — one per budget segment. Each row has a Campaign Filter keyword (e.g. "IndyCar"). Campaigns whose name *contains* that keyword belong to that segment and share its budget. An **empty-filter row** is the "Primary" segment: it automatically claims all campaigns *not* matched by any named filter for that account.

`Campaign.budget_label` stores the segment name. `Campaign.campaign_filter` stores the keyword.

### B. Grant account bypass
Accounts whose `account_name` contains the string `"grant"` (case-insensitive) are **exempt from auto-pause**. Their spend is still tracked and displayed, but the pause threshold check is skipped. This prevents auto-pausing Google Grant campaigns that are allowed to exceed normal caps.

Implemented in: `routes/pacing.py` → `run_pacing()` and `app.py` → `_run_pacing_for_account()`.

### C. Phantom channel type filtering
`LOCAL_SERVICES`, `SMART`, `HOTEL`, and `LOCAL` channel type campaigns are excluded from all spend/budget calculations. These use non-standard budget structures and would inflate totals with phantom budgets.

Implemented in: `google_ads_client.py` → `list_campaigns()` and `get_campaign_mtd_spend()`.

### D. Dead campaign protection
Historical MTD spend from ended/paused campaigns is **included** in budget tracking (a campaign that spent money earlier in the month still counts). However, `PacingData.current_daily_budget` is set to `0` for non-ENABLED campaigns so the dashboard's "active daily budget" metric stays accurate.

### E. Composite unique_id (for reference)
The original script sent data to Supabase using `account_id + "_" + budget_label` as a composite primary key to prevent segment rows from overwriting each other. BudgetBuddy's DB uses separate `Campaign` rows per campaign, so this is naturally handled — no composite key needed.

## Google Ads sheet section format

The monthly tab (e.g. `May 2026`) in the linked Google Sheet should have a **"Google Ads"** section header in column A. Rows under it:

| Col A          | Col B             | Col C          | Col D         |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Account Name   | Campaign Filter   | Monthly Budget | MTD Spend     |
| Phoenix Raceway| IndyCar           | 1000           | ← written back|
| Phoenix Raceway| Brand             | 500            | ← written back|
| Phoenix Raceway| (blank = Primary) | 2000           | ← written back|

If no "Google Ads" header exists, BudgetBuddy reads the entire sheet as Google Ads rows (backward-compatible with the original script format).

## DB migration notes

The following columns were added in May 2026. They do NOT exist in older DB deployments and require manual `ALTER TABLE` statements:

```sql
-- Campaign segment tracking
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN budget_label VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE campaigns ADD COLUMN campaign_filter VARCHAR(100);

-- Performance metrics on pacing snapshots
ALTER TABLE pacing_data ADD COLUMN clicks INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE pacing_data ADD COLUMN conversions FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE pacing_data ADD COLUMN cpc FLOAT;
```

On fresh deployments these are created automatically by `db.create_all()`.

## Change log

### 2026-05-19 — run-all timeout fix (background thread + Gunicorn bump)
**What:** Fixed Gunicorn worker timeout killing the "Run All" pacing job on larger MCCs.
**Why:** With 15+ accounts, sequential Google Ads API calls exceed the old 120s worker limit.
**Changes:**
- `backend/Procfile`: Bumped `--timeout 120` → `--timeout 300` as a safety net.
- `backend/routes/pacing.py`: `run-all` now mirrors the MCC sync pattern — acquires `_pacing_all_lock`, spawns `_run_pacing_all_job()` in a background thread, returns 202 immediately. Returns 409 if already running. The background job calls `run_pacing_for_account()` per account (sheet sync + spend fetch + PacingData write).

### 2026-05-18 — Campaign liveness filter + paused-but-spending inclusion
**What:** Fixed two related campaign filtering bugs.
**Bug 1 — Zombie ENABLED campaigns:** Campaigns with status=ENABLED but a past `campaign.end_date` were being treated as live and included in pacing. Fix: `list_campaigns()` now fetches `campaign.end_date`; a new `_is_campaign_live()` helper in `accounts.py` sets `is_active = True` only for ENABLED campaigns with no end date or a future end date.
**Bug 2 — PAUSED campaigns silently excluded:** PAUSED campaigns always got `is_active = False`, so spend they racked up earlier in the month was invisible. Fix: pacing runs now fetch MTD spend for ALL campaigns (live + inactive), then include inactive ones where `spend > 0` this month.
**Changes:**
- `backend/google_ads_client.py`: Added `campaign.end_date` to `list_campaigns()` SELECT; returned as `end_date` in each campaign dict.
- `backend/routes/accounts.py`: Added `_is_campaign_live(lc)` helper. All sync paths (`_sync_all_campaigns_for_account`, MCC sync loop, `import_campaigns`) use it instead of hardcoding `is_active=True`.
- `backend/routes/pacing.py`: `run_pacing`, `run_all_pacing`, `run_pacing_for_account` all split into `live_campaigns` + `inactive_campaigns`, fetch spend for all, then build `active_campaigns = live_campaigns + spending_inactive`.

### 2026-05-19 — Home dashboard spend fix + MCC sync now runs pacing
**What:** Fixed two bugs causing the home dashboard to show 0/0 spent for all accounts.
**Bug 1 — Missing campaigns in API response:** `Account.to_dict()` never included the `campaigns` array, so the home page's `/api/campaigns/all` response had `account.campaigns = undefined`. The frontend silently fell back to `[]` for every account → 0 spend, 0 budget. Fix: added `'campaigns': [c.to_dict() for c in self.campaigns]` to `Account.to_dict()` in `database.py`.
**Bug 2 — MCC sync didn't run pacing:** The home "Sync" button (`POST /api/accounts/sync-from-mcc`) synced campaigns and sheet budgets but never fetched MTD spend from Google Ads. Fix: moved `_run_pacing_for_account` from `app.py` into `routes/pacing.py` as `run_pacing_for_account(account, refresh_token_str, triggered_by)`, then called it at the end of `_run_mcc_sync_job` after sheet sync. The scheduler in `app.py` was also updated to import from `routes.pacing`.
**Changes:**
- `backend/database.py`: Added `'campaigns'` key to `Account.to_dict()`.
- `backend/routes/pacing.py`: Added `run_pacing_for_account()` at bottom of file.
- `backend/app.py`: Deleted inline `_run_pacing_for_account()`. Scheduler now calls `from routes.pacing import run_pacing_for_account`.
- `backend/routes/accounts.py`: Added pacing step at end of `_run_mcc_sync_job`. Final log includes paced count.

### 2026-05-18 — Script replacement + composite segmentation
**What:** Replaced the Google Ads MCC Script (Supabase pipeline) with BudgetBuddy handling everything natively. Ported all business rules from the script into the Flask backend.
**Why:** Consolidate to one system; add a proper UI; make pacing data accessible beyond the spreadsheet.
**Changes:**
- `backend/google_ads_client.py`: Added phantom channel type filtering (`LOCAL_SERVICES`, `SMART`, `HOTEL`, `LOCAL` excluded). `get_campaign_mtd_spend` now returns `{cid: {spend, clicks, conversions}}` instead of `{cid: spend_float}`.
- `backend/database.py`: Added `budget_label`, `campaign_filter` to `Campaign`. Added `clicks`, `conversions`, `cpc` to `PacingData`.
- `backend/routes/pacing.py`: Grant account bypass (skips auto-pause for accounts with "grant" in name). Updated to unpack new spend dict shape. Stores clicks/conversions/CPC on `PacingData`.
- `backend/routes/sheets.py`: Added `_get_google_ads_section()`, `sync_google_ads_budgets_for_account()`, `write_google_ads_spend_for_account()` and endpoints `POST /api/sheets/<id>/sync-google-ads` and `POST /api/sheets/<id>/write-google-ads-spend`.
- `backend/app.py`: Updated scheduler's `_run_pacing_for_account` for new spend dict shape + Grant bypass.
- `scripts/google_ads_budget_pacer.js`: Original script stored for reference (do not deploy).

### 2026-05-18 — MCC account name fix + inline rename
**What:** Fixed accounts imported from MCC showing only numeric IDs instead of real names.
**Why:** `customer_client.descriptive_name` is empty for some account types (test accounts, recently-created accounts). The old code silently fell back to `"Account <id>"`.
**Changes:**
- `backend/google_ads_client.py`: Added `_fetch_customer_name()` — makes a secondary per-account GAQL query (`SELECT customer.descriptive_name FROM customer`) when `descriptiveName` is missing. Added `_fmt_customer_id()` as a final XXX-XXX-XXXX fallback. Updated `list_mcc_child_accounts` to use both.
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`: `ImportMccModal` now renders each account name as an editable input so users can fix names before clicking Import. Home page account cards now have an inline pencil-icon rename flow (click → edit field → ✓ / ✗), saved via `PUT /api/accounts/:id`.
